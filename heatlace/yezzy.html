                <h2 style="font-size: 8vw;">Adidas Wave</h2>
                <p>
                    Adidas was trying to combat Nike's sales by introducing a new comfort technology called boost. This was the answer Adidas needed to go against Nike's infamous Air technology. As Kanye's relationship with Nike started to plummet, Adidas was knocking at Kanye's door and through him Adidas was able to revamp their entire brand. </p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 8vw;">Adidas Boost</h2>
                <p> Adidas boost was the softest technology to be introduced to the sneaker world, since Nike's Air Max technology. Many consumers claimed it to be the softest cushioning system on their feet. People who first tried out boost were saying that it was like walking on clouds.</p></div>

                <h2 style="font-size: 8vw;">Everyone Wins</h2>
                <p> Kanye West was unhappy with Nike because Nike was not giving him royalties on his Nike Yeezy releases. The reason he wanted those royalties were because many of his sneakers would sold out in a matter of seconds and whatever Kanye would wear, it would sell in large quantities. So as a result, he believed he deserved some money for his name being a massive selling point. Once he switched to Adidas, he was granted royalties to all Adidas collaborations with him and was given a verbal promise by Adidas, that all his fans would be able to own a pair of his shoes.  </p>
